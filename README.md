## Instructions for this GAMES API!

Once you have cloned down the project, be sure to run `npm install` to instal all the relevant packages. Most of what you need is there already, but you will additionally need to install `express` and `supertest`


You will need to create two .env files for your project: 
.env.test and .env.development

In .env.test you should put PGDATABASE=nc_games_test
and In .env.development you should put PGDATABASE=nc_games

Then you're ready to go!
